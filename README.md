# About
Deliveries are stressful - especially if you have to pack all stuff into a small container.

Even worse - the container is carried by owls.

In this game, you are in charge of packaging deliveries, one by one.

# How to play
Place all items inside the container by selecting the desired item, then move it around using one of the various available methods (see **Movement** for details).

Once all items are placed inside the container, the package is sent off - and you can (must) start packing the next delivery.

You can replay a level as often as you like.

**There is also a Tutorial ingame - be sure to check it out!**
